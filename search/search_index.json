Needed 10 hours of support per week to read print and to verify my own created print was correct. My gold standard for accessibility (longer description below ). I use HTML for everything today, because it is the same for me as it is for my audience. It puts me on par with the sighted world, well almost. 2022 was the first year I did not need to have weekly human support. I did my own writing, proof-reading, and all of my marking. I am more functional and more employable today than I was when I got my first full time job 20 years ago, all because I have improved access to journal articles, books, and other works . Access is not a pipe dream; it is really possible, but most people do not have the available tools to deliver access I need. I know it exists because I create accessible content all the time. My gold standard Full access for a blind person applying techniques commonly taught in STEM related courses, either in educational or employment settings, as well as for the sheer pleasure of science, can only be verified if the following conditions are met in a way that ensures the blind person\u2019s independence and dignity. All material presented by another party must be able to be read by a blind person using whatsoever hardware and software tools provide an equitable outcome as that attained by their sighted peers. A blind person must be able to collect, analyse, interpret, and manipulate scientific data in order to answer scientific questions and communicate the knowledge gained from their results in a way that can be read by their sighted peers.","title":"Dr. Jonathan Godfrey's Presentation Overview"},{"location":"materials/presentation-jg.html#dr-jonathan-godfreys-presentation-overview","text":"Return to main Presentations page","title":"Dr. Jonathan Godfrey's Presentation Overview"},{"location":"materials/presentation-jg.html#topics-covered","text":"Who I am Completed my PhD using LaTeX, because I couldn\u2019t write an equation otherwise.
